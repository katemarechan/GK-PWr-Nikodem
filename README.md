# GK-PWr-Nikodem
This folder will contain labs for the class Grafika Komputerowa z Panem Doktorem Janem Nikodemem

The labs are made in Python.. I personally recommend using PyCharm and Python for the labs, since its easier to download the needed libraries that way.
Heads up, the labs are not perfectly made, but i had fun making them. On top of source code, theres also documentation for each lab.

Mistakes pointed out by the professor: besides the egg, there also should be a model of a teapot. On the egg, theres a "stitch" on the side of it. It happens because the pixels are overlapping, you can change that by slightly changing the logic of the egg coloring. 

If you have any questions -- feel free to ask, this was a subject and class that i enjoyed a lot personally.
